# Traversability Estimation
A ROS2 package for estimating traversability on pointclouds and 3D path planning for ground robots.

# Building
Use docker to build the package:
```bash
docker compose -f docker/compose.yaml build
```

# Running
Use docker to run the package:
```bash
xhost local:root
docker compose -f docker/compose.yaml up
```

If you have nvidia docker you can use:
```bash
xhost local:root
docker compose -f docker/compose_nvidia.yaml up
```
The system takes a few secconds to estimate traversability and generate a graph.

Your terminal should look like this:

```bash

```

After the graph has been built, use the `Publish Point` button in RViz (at the top left) to select start and goal points.
